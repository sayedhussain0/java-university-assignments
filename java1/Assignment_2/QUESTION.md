# Assignment 2 -Question

Write a Java program that prompt the user to enter four double numbers a, b, c, d representing the 
sides of rhombus and two double numbers d1 and d2 representing the diagonals of rhombus.
Based on the length of a, b, c, d check if the shape is rhombus or not:
  1) Rhombus: If all the sides a, b, c and d are equal.
  2) Not Rhombus: If all the sides a, b, c and d are not equal
Afterwards, calculate and display the shape area using the following equation (If and only if it is a Rhombus):
              Area = d1*d2/2


**************************************************
     
(1) Sample Input/Output

Enter side a, b, c and d= 15.0 15.0 15.0 15.0

The shape is rhombus

Enter diagonals d1 and d2 = 24

Shape Area = 216


**************************************************

(2) Sample Input/Output

Enter side a, b, c and d= 9.0 9.9 8.3 7.7

The shape is not rhombus
