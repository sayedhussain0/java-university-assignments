Create a class called "RoomCarpet" that has four private data members:
1) A (String) name
2) A (double) length.
3) A (double) width.
4) A (double) cost.

Additionally, the class should also include the following methods:
1) Three set methods to set each data members.
2) Three get methods to get each data members.
3) A method getArea that returns the area of the room. The area of the room is computed by multiplying the room’s length by the room’s width.
4) A method getTotalCost that returns the total cost of the carpet. The total cost is computed by multiplying the room area by the carpet cost per square meter.
5)  A method named printAll to print "RoomCarpet" information (variables).

Create a main and create object as the following:
*************************
Name = Carpet 1 
*************************
Length = 3.0
*************************
Width = 4.0
*************************
Cost = 100.0
*************************
Area = 12.0
*************************
Total cost = 1200.0
